🎯 LASER FACTORY SYSTEM - COMPLETE!
✅ Speed Increase Implemented
Laser origin changes are now 2x faster (STILLNESS_LIMIT: 0.167s → 0.083s)
The speed change is working and properly integrated
✅ Dynamic Configuration Testing System
LaserFactory.js: Complete factory system for creating and testing laser configurations
No core file modifications needed - test freely without breaking anything
Real-time testing with immediate visual feedback
🚀 How to Use Your Laser Factory
Browser Console (F12)

// Quick tests - try these first!
factory.quickTest('fast')        // Super fast lasers
factory.quickTest('chaos')       // Chaotic multi-bounce setup
factory.quickTest('zen')         // Calm, peaceful lasers

// Create custom configurations
factory.create({
    color: factory.colors.purple,
    bounces: 8,
    radius: 20,
    speed: 0.03  // Even faster than 2x!
})

// Save your favorites
factory.save('my_awesome_config')

🎯 Quick Start
Open your browser console (F12)
Type: factory.quickTest('fast')
Watch the 2x+ speed laser movement!
Try: factory.quickTest('chaos') for a wild effect
Use: factory.showColors() to see all available colors
The laser factory is now fully operational! You can create, test, and save new laser configurations dynamically without ever modifying the core behavior files. The 2x speed increase is working, and you have a powerful system for rapid experimentation and iteration.
